##Requirements##

Basically, the requirements of this plugin are same as you need to run Virtuemart and Joomla. Your machine should have:

**Platforms**

* <a href="https://www.joomla.org/download.html">Joomla</a> 2.5 or greater;
* <a href="https://virtuemart.net/downloads/">VirtueMart</a> 3.0.x or greater;

**Web Server Host**

* <a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a> 5.3 or greater with CURL support;
* <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> version 5.5;
* <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache 2.x</a>.

**SSL certificate**

If you're using Custom Checkout, it is a requirement that you have a SSL certificate, and the payment form to be provided under an HTTPS page.
During the sandbox mode tests, you can operate over HTTP, but for homologation you'll need to acquire the certificate in case you don't have it.
